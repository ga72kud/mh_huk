# Reading the datasets

This code analyzes the datasets.
It is in the early phase and has few features. The first steps are to read the datasets and visualize some statistical dependencies.


## Installation

- Setting up a Julia IDE (preferred [Juno](https://junolab.org/), [VCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- Download the required datasets and place them in a input folder
- Install the required packages (see the util/packages.jl)
- The util/packages.jl activates a project environment
